# Mission // #003
## Floodgate

Patience puts the colony at its maximum security level and asks the squad to be on high alert. They are asked to stay around the colony while Evergreen scouts try to predict the movements of the Hercynian raiders.  
Before anyone can gather more intel, a nighttime attack on the colony forces the team into action.

# Goals
- Investigate the signal. Fight back the
Machineâ€™s horde

# Stakes
- If the PCs are unable to beat back the
horde, it will grow stronger and there will
be many civilian casualties as the militia
struggle to cover evacuation efforts

# Reserves
- Check reserves from downtime activities
and previous missions before beginning
the mission.
