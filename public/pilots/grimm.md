Kierra Elena Blackwood was the only daughter of war hero Lieutenant Colonel Charles Albert Blackwood and Sergeant Rachel Ann Blackwood née Graham. Though she was raised by primarily her mother as her father was most days off on missions with his battalion. She grew up hearing of his deeds alongside the ever present, "You’ll have your own stories to tell one day.”

At nineteen her mother had her younger brother William Elias Blackwood. This was also the year her father finally retired having lost his leg and the ability to have any further children.
5 years into her career though the battalion she served under suffered massive casualties with Kierra being the only survivor. Months went by as she recovered, having sustained several injuries herself. The worst  of it however, were the debilitating nightmares and a fear of the frontline.

Though she did her damndest to learn to hide her fear behind between either a cocky exterior or just silence depending on the day, not wanting her father’s disappointment. She knew though she would have to tell him something as her fears made it impossible for her to go back on to the front line.
Half a year before her birthday she finally asked for a transfer to backline sniper support. This would anger her father quite a bit and he fought against it for a while. He finally gave her his blessing on the eve of her twenty-fifth birthday. With that she trained under the best snipers her father could find until she was contracted for her current Lancer mission.
