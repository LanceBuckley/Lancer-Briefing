Claudio Von Steimer is a determined youth raised in a restrictive corporate environment. He finds freedom in tinkering with explosives, one of the few dangerous activities he was allowed to partake in.

After a summer of study in the trade baronnies he became obsessed with old world nobility. In his studies on the topic he stumbled upon the concept of noblesse oblige, and decided he needed to experience life on the front lines if he were to ever be worthy of leading. 

Because of his upbringing he has trouble accepting anything less than excellence from those around him. He aspires to be the best at what he does, and when others don't measure up, he dismisses them.
