Doc is a 6 foot tall early 20’s male with brown hair a slender build and a thin handlebar mustache(like the famous old humanity gunslinger Doc Holiday). His left eye has been replaced by a fairly simple robotic eye. He wears a typical cowboy hat with a black coat animal skin vest standard button up shirt.

“Doc” is not his real name, it is an alias that he used once and it stuck. Doc was born in the Long Rim. Living there was tough and cruel but he got by his way by being a “real man”. Doc believes that everyone should be a “real man” and make their own decisions to live life their own way by themselves. Doc’s way of living was to be a free man who did what he wanted. In many cases this made him a criminal.

He never joined any gangs or syndicates and often stole from the various crime lords of the Long Rim and exposed them. Doc was alone having no connection to anyone. He made more then enough money to quit but he never did. He doesn’t know why, he felt compelled to keep going and never questioned it.

On his last job he found some secrete info on Smith-Shimano Corp, some sort of alchemical recipe or code. In response he was captured by the government who were "tipped" off" thanks to SSC. He was arrested and in exchange for his freedom became a Lancer for the Third Committee.
